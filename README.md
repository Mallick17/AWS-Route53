# DNS Records
- A Domain Name System Record is a set of instructions used to connect domain names with internet protocol (IP) addresses within DNS servers. DNS makes it possible for users to browse the internet with customizable domain names and URLs rather than complex numerical IP addresses.
- This function—translating human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses—is the reason that DNS is often referred to as "the phonebook of the internet." DNS records are a vital part making this process fast and secure for internet users.
- DNS records are simple text files called "zone files" that give instructions on how to handle DNS requests. When you type a website address into your browser, a DNS query is created. This query is sent to multiple DNS servers, which use DNS records to find the correct IP address and connect you to the website. These records are stored on special DNS servers called authoritative nameservers. They also include a setting called "time-to-live" (TTL), which tells how long the information is considered valid before being updated.
- Commonly used DNS records include: A and AAAA records, CNAME, DNAME and ALIAS records, CAA records, CERT records, MX records, SOA records, NS records, PTR records, SPF records, SRV records and TXT records. Each of these records has a unique function and understanding each is an important part of a functioning DNS system.

## Common types of DNS Records
DNS management relies on the interconnectedness of DNS servers. Knowing how your DNS servers interact with each other through DNS records will make managing your DNS a less daunting task.

- The most common types of DNS records are:

### Key Points:
- **A and AAAA Records** link domain names to IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6, respectively).
- **CNAME Records** help create easier management of subdomains by pointing them to a canonical domain.
- **DNAME Records** allow for the redirection of multiple subdomains with one record.
- **MX Records** are essential for directing email traffic to the correct server.
- **SPF Records** help verify that only authorized servers can send emails on behalf of your domain.
- **SRV Records** are used for specifying services (like messaging or VoIP) associated with a domain.
- **TXT Records** store text-based information for security purposes, such as email verification and spam prevention.
